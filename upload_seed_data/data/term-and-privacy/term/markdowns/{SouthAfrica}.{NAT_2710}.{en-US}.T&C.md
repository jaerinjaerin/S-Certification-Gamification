How to participate in Galaxy AI Expert Certification

Samsung+ Users

After logging in to the Samsung+ app, you can access the training modules. Participation in the quiz is allowed only after completing the training. Once you have passed all quiz stages, you will receive the online Galaxy AI Expert badge.

Samsung+ Non-Users

If you are not using the Samsung+ app, you must first complete the online or offline training provided by your local subsidiary. After training has been completed, you can participate in the quiz via the link that Samsung provides to your subsidiary. Once you have passed all quiz stages, you will receive the online Galaxy AI Expert badge.

It is possible to retake and pass the quiz multiple times, but only one badge will be awarded.

Each stage of the quiz has a limit of five incorrect answers. If this limit is reached before completion of a stage, that stage must be restarted at the first question. The certification quiz must be completed individually. Any cheating will result in disqualification and invalidation of quiz results. Galaxy AI Expert Certification is free of charge.
